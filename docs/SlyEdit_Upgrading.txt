This file contains upgrade notes for sysops who are upgrading from
earlier versions of SlyEdit.

   below
2. New configuration file settings


"Expand Line Feeds to CRLF" option
==================================
If upgrading version version 1.07 or earlier of SlyEdit, the option
"Expand Line Feeds to CRLF" in SCFG should now be set to Yes.  This
option enables Synchronet to save messages properly, regardless of
whether Synchronet is running in Windows or a *nix system.  Enabling
this option fixes problems with line wrapping that was seen on Linux
Synchronet systems when the messages were sent across some networks
to other BBSs.  Thanks goes to Access Denied, sysop of The Pharcyde,
for helping to test this.

In Synchronet's configuration program, your SlyEdit
configuration should look like this (ICE mode is used here):

2. Notes and new configuration file settings
============================================
Upgrading to version 1.20
-------------------------
Version 1.20 added a cross-posting feature, and there is a new configuration
setting and some new color settings for cross-posting.  Also, starting with
version 1.20, you can put your customized SlyEdit configuration file
(SlyEdit.cfg) and color theme files in the sbbs/mods directory so that they
won't be accidentally overwritten when updating the Synchronet files from the
Synchronet CVS repository.

New setting for SlyEdit.cfg:
allowCrossPosting                 Whether or not to allow cross-posting
                                  messages into different/multiple message
                                  areas.  Valid values are true and false.

New color settings (for both the DCT and Ice-style theme files):
crossPostBorder                   The color to use for the border of the cross-
                                  post area selection box

crossPostBorderText               The color to use for the top border text of

crossPostMsgAreaNum               The color to use for the message group/sub-
                                  board numbers in the cross-post area
                                  selection box

crossPostMsgAreaNumHighlight      The color to use for the highlighted
                                  (lightbar) message group/sub-board numbers
                                  in the cross-post area selection box

crossPostMsgAreaDesc              The color to use for the message group/
                                  sub-board descriptions in the cross-post
                                  area selection box

crossPostMsgAreaDescHighlight     The color to use for the highlighted
                                  (lightbar) message group/sub-board
                                  descriptions in the cross-post area selection
                                  box

crossPostChk                      The color to use for the checkmarks for the
                                  enabled message sub-boards in the cross-post
                                  area selection box

crossPostChkHighlight             The color to use for the highlighted
                                  (lightbar) checkmarks for the enabled
                                  message sub-boards in the cross-post area
                                  selection box

crossPostMsgGrpMark               The color to use for the current message
                                  group marker character in the cross-post area

                                  box

Upgrading to version 1.18
-------------------------
* Important: If you use Digital Distortion's Message Lister on your BBS, then
you must update Digital Distortion's Message Lister must to at least version
1.31 in order for message quoting with author's initials to work properly when
replying to a message from Digital Distortion's Message Lister.
The latest version of the Digital Distortion BBS doors & add-ons can be
downloaded from the following web page:
http://digdist.bbsindex.com/DigDistBBSStuff/DigDistBBSStuff.html

A feature has been added to allow quoted lines with author's initials to be
indented by a space.  It is disabled by default.  To enable that option,
add the following line in SlyEdit.cfg in the [BEHAVIOR] section:
indentQuoteLinesWithInitials=true
That option can also be set to false to disable it.

Upgrading to version 1.17
-------------------------
Starting with version 1.17, when replying to a message, quoted lines from the
previous message will be prefixed with the last author's initials by default.
If desired, this behavior can be disabled by adding the following line in the
[BEHAVIOR] section of SlyEdit.cfg:
useQuoteLineInitials=false
When disabled, SlyEdit will quote message lines as before, prefixing them with
" > " as was done in IceEdit, DCT Edit, and other editors of the early-mid
1990s.
Since many users participate in public message areas, it is recommended to let
SlyEdit add the last author's initials to quote lines in order to make it
easier for other readers to identify who wrote which parts and make it easier
to follow the conversation.
That option can also be set to true in SlyEdit.cfg to enable it.

Upgrading to version 1.16
-------------------------
As of version 1.16, the configuration files may be placed in the sbbs/ctrl
directory if desired, and the .js files can be placed anywhere else (for
(example, sbbs/exec would work easily).

Also, the following notes apply if upgrading from a version below 1.15:

Upgrading to version 1.15
-------------------------
In version 1.15, the configuration setting "splitLongQuoteLines" was
removed and replaced with the following setting:
reWrapQuoteLines: Whether or not to re-wrap quote lines so that quoted
                  text is complete yet still looks good when quoted.
Also added the following configuration options and capabilities:
add3rdPartyStartupScript:
            Add a 3rd-party JavaScript script to execute
            (via loading) upon startup of SlyEdit.  The
            parameter must specify the full path & filename
            of the JavaScript script.  For example (using
            the excellent Desafortunadamente add-on by Art
            of Fat Cats BBS):
            add3rdPartyStartupScript=D:/BBS/sbbs/xtrn/desafortunadamente/desafortunadamente.js
addJSOnStart:
            Add a JavaScript command to run on startup.  Any
            commands added this way will be executed after
            3rd-party scripts are loaded.
            Example (using the excellent Desafortunadamente
            add-on by Art of Fat Cats BBS):
            addJSOnStart=fortune_load();
add3rdPartyExitScript:
            Add a 3rd-party JavaScript script to execute
            (via loading) upon exit of SlyEdit.  The
            parameter must specify the full path & filename
            of the JavaScript script.
addJSOnExit:
            Add a JavaScript command to run on exit.
            Example (don't actually do this):
            addJSOnStart=console.print("Hello\n\1p");

Upgrading to version 1.08
-------------------------
In version 1.08, two new configuration settings were added to the main
configuration file (SlyEdit.cfg) in the BEHAVIOR section:

userInputTimeout                  Whether or not to use an input timeout
                                  for users.  Valid values are true and
                                  false.  Note: The input timeout is not
                                  used for sysops.

inputTimeoutMS                    The amount of time (in milliseconds) to
                                  use for the input timeout.

Note that the sysop is now always exempt from the input timeout.

In version 1.13, another new setting was added to the main configuration
file (SlyEdit.cfg) in the BEHAVIOR section:

splitLongQuoteLines               Whether or not to split quote lines
                                  that are too long (rather than truncating
                                  them).  Valid values are true and false.
                                  If true, quote lines that are too long will
                                  be wrapped (rather than truncated), with the
                                  last word(s) on their own separate line.
                                  If this option is not specified, this feature
                                  will be disabled by default.

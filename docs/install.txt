Installing Synchronet BBS for Win32 v3.0 Revision C
===================================================

This version has been succesfully tested with the 
following operating systems:

	o Microsoft Windows 95
	o Microsoft Windows 95a
	o Microsoft Windows 95b (OSR2)
	o Microsoft Windows 98
	o Microsoft Windows 98 SE
	o Microsoft Windows Me
	o Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
	o Microsoft Windows NT 4
	o Microsoft Windows 2000

If you are upgrading an existing installation of 
Synchronet (v2.3 or v3.0), it is advised that you
choose "Custom" Setup and disable the following
installation components:

	o Configuration Files
	o Text and Menu Files
	o External Programs

It is recommended that you install Synchronet into
the default installation directory (C:\SBBS). If you
choose to install into a different location, it is
strongly recommended that you use \SBBS or another
MS-DOS compatible 8.3 format path name (e.g. D:\SBBS,
NOT D:\Synchronet). Installing into a location other
than C:\SBBS will require  modification of the
following files for full operation:

	o EXEC\VERT.BAT
	o EXEC\VERT.FTP
	o EXEC\TIMED.BAT
	o TEXT\BULLSEYE.CFG


SBBSCTRL (Synchronet Control Panel)
~~~~~~~~
SBBSCTRL is the Sysop's console for SBBS v3 for Win32. You
still must use SCFG to configure the BBS options shared
between the new and old versions.

The installation program will create a short-cut to 
SBBSCTRL.EXE on your desktop and in your startup folder 
(so Synchronet will start automatically during boot-up).


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Moving messages between message areas will corrupt the
  message base.
o DOSKEY must be loaded in your autoexec.bat for the DOS 
  shell to work right (Windows 95/98/ME)
o Backspace doesn't work right in DOS shell (Windows 95/98/ME)
o First node (set in SBBSCTRL) configuration is used for all 
  nodes (this is actually intentional, i.e. not a bug)
o First node's temp directory must be set to "TEMP\"


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sysop documentation has been converted to HTML format,
but is no longer included in the installation package due
to size considerations. See http://synchro.net/docs for the
online docs or download ftp://synchro.net/sbbsdocs.zip
for a local installation.


Ordering/Registering Synchronet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Synchronet (as of April 1997) is FREEWARE - no registration or 
licensing fee is required.

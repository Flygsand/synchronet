Upgrading to Synchronet BBS for Win32 v3.0c
===========================================

This is an UPGRADE ONLY, so you must have Synchronet (v2.3 or 
v3.0b) already installed before you can continue. A full
Synchronet installation package can be obtained via FTP or 
Telnet/Zmodem from vert.synchro.net.

This version has been tested with the following operating
systems:

	o Microsoft Windows 95
	o Microsoft Windows 95a
	o Microsoft Windows 95b (OSR2)
	o Microsoft Windows 98
	o Microsoft Windows Me
	o Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
	o Microsoft Windows NT 4
	o Microsoft Windows 2000


Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files will be over-written by this upgrade, so
if you have customized them, it is highly recommended that you
make a BACK-UP of the files before continuing this installation:

	SBBS\CTRL\TEXT.DAT		(Text Strings)
	SBBS\CTRL\GURU.DAT		(Guru Brain)
	SBBS\CTRL\ATTR.CFG		(Default Colors)
	SBBS\CTRL\ALIAS.CFG		(Internet Mail Aliases)
	SBBS\CTRL\FTPALIAS.CFG		(FTP Filename Aliases)
	SBBS\TEXT\MENU\LOGON.ASC	(Logon Screen)
	SBBS\TEXT\MENU\EXEMPT.ASC	(Exemption Descriptions)
	SBBS\TEXT\MENU\EDITOR.ASC	(Internal Editor Menu)
	SBBS\TEXT\MENU\MSGSCAN.ASC	(Message Scan Menu)
	SBBS\TEXT\MENU\MAILREAD.ASC	(Mail Read Menu)

Two of the unused lines in CTRL\TEXT.DAT (lines 62 and 74) are
now used in v3. If you're going to allow auto-logon by IP or
sending of Internet e-mail, then you'll need to use the TEXT.DAT
included (or modify your own). If you're still going to be using 
v2.3c (or earlier), you'll want to eliminate one of the %s's from 
the MsgAttr line in your TEXT.DAT.

If you do not want these files installed (you're upgrading a
previous installation of SBBS v3 for example), choose "Custom
Installation" and disable the "Configuration Files" from the
install set.


Command Shell Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files will be over-written by this upgrade, so
if you have customized them, it is highly recommended that you
make a BACK-UP of the files before continuing this installation:

	SBBS\EXEC\RENEGADE.SRC		(Renegade Command Shell)
	SBBS\EXEC\RENEGADE.BIN		(Renegade Command Shell)


SBBSCTRL
~~~~~~~~
SBBSCTRL is the Sysop's console for SBBS v3. You still must use
SCFG to configure the BBS options shared between the new and old
versions.

The installation program will create a short-cut to SBBSCTRL.EXE
on your desktop and in your startup folder (so Synchronet will
start automatically during boot-up).


Update Your Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you run your BBS with v3, you'll need to go through all
of your command lines in SCFG (SBBSCTRL->BBS->Configure) and
make sure there aren't any hard-coded relative paths.

For example, you must change SCFG->File Options->Testable Files
       %!pkzip -z %f < ..\text\zipmsg.txt
to:    %!pkzip -z %f < %zzipmsg.txt

If you have any Baja modules that assume the current directory
(use relative paths), they need to be fixed too.

Relative paths in "data directories" in SCFG are okay. Only
executable command lines need to be changed to absolute paths
("%n..\xtrn\etc" is okay).

Also, make sure that all of your external programs either use DOS
I/O interception (XSDK/WWIV doors) or utilize a FOSSIL driver
(i.e. use FDSZ or CEXYZ instead of DSZ). The COM ports and baud
rates configured for your doors are irrelevant.


Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~
o DOSKEY must be loaded in your autoexec.bat for the DOS shell to
  work right (Windows 95/98)
o Backspace doesn't work right in DOS shell (Windows 95/98)
o QNET.BIN doesn't work (see DOVE-NET.ZIP for alternatives)
o First node (set in SBBSCTRL) configuration is used for all nodes
  (this is actually intentional, i.e. not a bug)
o First node's temp directory must be set to "TEMP\"

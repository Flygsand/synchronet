<h2><a name="AddingNodes">[3.0] - Adding Nodes</a></h2>
<pre>Run SCFG. Select Nodes from the main menu. Hit INS (insert key) to create 
additional nodes. Each added node will have the configuration options copied
from the last node. No configuration changes should be necessary.
</pre>
<pre><b>SBBSCTRL-Windows:</b>

	If you'd like all nodes to be available for telnet logins, set the
<b>	Last Node</b> in the telnet configuration dialog to your highest 
	configured node number.</pre>
<pre>	 <img border="0" src="images/sbbsctrl_telnet_cfg_gen.png" width="358" height="318"></pre>
<pre>	 All nodes controlled by the same instance of SBBSCTRL will use the
	 configuration information for the node specified as the <b>First Node
</b>	 in the telnet configuration dialog.</pre>
<pre>Alternatively, you can edit the <i>LastNode</i> value in the <i>[BBS]</i> section of your
Synchronet initialization file (e.g. <i>ctrl/sbbs.ini</i>).</pre>
<h2><a name="ConfiguringNodes">[3.1] - Configuring Nodes</a></h2>
<pre>To configure a node, select &quot;<i>Nodes</i>&quot; from the SCFG &quot;<i>Configure</i>&quot; menu. You will
then see a list of all the nodes installed on your system. You will also see
the bottom line of the screen now has two additional key commands added, <i>INS
</i>(Insert) and <i>DEL</i> (Delete). INS and DEL are used to add and delete nodes from
the system. If you select one of the nodes listed, you will receive another
menu as follows:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1.png" width="652" height="331"></pre>
<pre>
<b>Logon Requirements:
</b>        Use this option to set specific requirements to logon this node.</pre>
<h2><a name="NodeToggleOptions">[3.2] - Node Toggle Options</a></h2>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1_toggles.png" width="652" height="331">


<b>Allow Logon by Number:
</b>	Setting this option to 'Yes' will allow users to logon by typing their
	user number at the login logon prompt.

<b>Allow Logon by Real Name:
</b>	When set to 'Yes' this option allows users to enter their real name
	(or company name) at the login prompt to logon to the BBS.

<b>Always Prompt for Password:
</b>	When set to 'Yes' this option will cause the user to ALWAYS be prompted
	for a password at logon, even if they have entered an incorrect (non-
	existent) user name at the login prompt.

<b>Allow 8-bit Remote Logons:
</b>	To allow E-7-1 terminals to use this node, set this option to 'No'.
	This will also eliminate the ability of 8-bit remote users to send
	IBM extended ASCII characters during the logon sequence.</pre>
<pre><b>Spinning Pause Prompt:</b>
	To disable the spinning cursor on screen-pause prompts, set this option
	to 'No'.</pre>
<pre><b>Keep Node File Open:</b>
	It can benefit performance to leave the node file (ctrl/node.dab) open.
	If you have problems with the node file being read correctly across network
	drives (on a LAN), try setting this option to 'No'.</pre>
<h2><a name="NodeAdvancedOptions">[3.3] - Node Advanced Options</a></h2>
<pre>When selecting this option, you will be brought to a sub-menu of options as
follows:</pre>
<pre><img border="0" src="images/scfg_node1_advanced.png" width="652" height="331">

<b>Validation User:
</b>        This is the number of the user to whom validation feedback is sent.
        This value will usually be set to 1 (the sysop). If this value is set
        to 0, then <b>new users will not be required to enter validation feedback</b>.

<b>Semaphore Frequency:
</b>	This option specifies how often (in seconds) this node should perform
	semaphore checks (e.g. checks to see if an event should be run, the
	node should be downed, etc.).

<b>Statistics Frequency:
</b>	This options specifies how often (in seconds) this node should check
	system statistics (calls per day, logons today, etc.).

<b>Inactivity Warning:
</b>	This is the number of seconds of user inactivity before a warning
	(typically: &quot;Username, are you still there?&quot;) is displayed to the
	user.

<b>Inactivity Disconnection:
</b>	This is the number of seconds of user inactivity before the user
	is automatically disconnected.

<b>Daily Event:
</b>        This is the command line to execute when the first caller after
        midnight logs off. If the program is located in the EXEC directory,
        this command line should start with the %! specifier.

<b>Text Directory:
</b>        This is the path to the text directory. This is where all menus,
        macros, SIF files, QWK files, system information, and other text
        files are stored.</pre>

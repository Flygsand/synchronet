*** Synchronet v3.10 Instant Message Support ***

To use the new "Instant message" feature, you need to do the following:

o You must be running the Synchronet SMTP Mail Server on port 25
  (publicly accessible).

o You must be running the Synchronet Finger Service (exec/fingerservice.js)
  - The UDP-Finger service is encouraged for faster user listings.
  - This is enabled by default (both TCP and UDP) in the included
    ctrl/services.cfg.

o You should also have your BBS in the Synchronet BBS List (SBL) database.
  - See http://synchro.net/sbbslist.html

o Put the updated chat.asc in your text/menu directory.
  - This is an updated chat menu that contains the [F]inger and [I]nstant
    Message commands.

o Create the following timed-event in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->External
  Programs->Timed Events:

	Internal Code                   GETIMLST
	Start-up Directory
	Command Line                    *getimlst
	Execution Node                  1
	Execution Days                  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
	Execution Time                  12:00
	Requires Exclusive Execution    No
	Force Users Off-line For Event  No

  This event will retieve a current list of BBSes that are instant-message
  enabled daily.

Now you will have an [I]nstant message option available from your [C]hat menu
where your users can [L]ist other users, send [M]essages to active users or
[T]elegrams to any user and system that supports SMTP telegrams.

That's it! :-)

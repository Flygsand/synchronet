Q: DOS programs (e.g. editors, door games) won't run on my Windows Vista-32
   system running Synchronet-Win32.
A: There are 2 new requirements for 16-bit DOS programs to work under
   Synchronet-Win32 on Windows Vista-32:
   1. You must have SBBSEXEC.DLL rev 38 or later (this is included in SBBS
      v3.14a).
   2. You must copy SBBSEXEC.DLL to your Windows "System32" folder.

Q: DOS programs won't run on my 64-bit Windows system.
A: Microsoft does not include Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) support in their
   64-bit operating systems. Synchronet for Windows relies on NTVDM for
   16-bit DOS program support, so you need to either run a 32-bit Windows
   (e.g. re-install, use dual-boot, or run in a Virtual Machine) or forego
   DOS programs on your BBS.

Q: I want to create custom menus. Is there any detailed documentation or
   samples regarding custom menus on Synchronet?  
A: Yes, see the customization chapter in the Synchronet Sysop Manual
   (http://synchro.net/docs/customization.html), the Baja Manual
   (http://synchro.net/docs/baja.html), or Synchronet JavaScript page
   (http://synchro.net/docs/js.html) for details.

Q: How do I get on the Synchronet BBS List (http://synchro.net/sbbslist.html)?
A: The best way is to first join DOVE-Net, then run the Synchronet BBS List
   (SBL) door on *your* BBS and add an entry for your BBS. This entry should
   be automatically exported to the DOVE-Net SYNCDATA echo which will then be
   propagated to Vertrauen and every other BBS on DOVE-Net. The sbbslist.html
   page is automatically generated on Vertrauen every night at midnight
   (Pacific time), so wait a day or so for your entry to appear on the list.
   If it doesn't appear, verify that that your BBS entry was properly
   exported (as a message) to the SYNCDATA message area. The events that run
   SMB2SBL and SBL2SMB to import and export BBS entries should be configured
   by default. If they are not, see xtrn/sbl/sbl.doc for more details.

Q: How do I get my BBS listed in the Instant-Message capable BBS list
   (ftp://ftp.synchro.net/sbbsimsg.lst)?
A: First get your BBS on the Synchronet BBS List (sbbslist.html), and if your
   BBS is running the Synchronet SMTP server on port 25 (like it should) and
   the Synchronet Finger Service on TCP and UDP port 79, your BBS should
   automatically appear in the instant message list. If it is not, then
   verify that your SMTP and Finger services can be reached remotely (the
   ports aren't being blocked by a firewall or your ISP).  This list
   is generated nightly on Vertrauen at the same time as the Synchronet BBS 
   List (http://synchro.net/sbbslist.html).
   See docs/imsgdocs.txt for more details.

Q: How do I know what ports Synchronet needs opened through my firewall?
A: The answer depends on what Synchronet servers and services you have enabled
   and whatever ports you have configured Synchronet to use for each.
   See http://synchro.net/docs/tcpip_faq.html for details.

Q: How do I join DOVE-Net?
A: If you've installed v3.10 or later, Telnet to vert.synchro.net and create a
   new account for your QWKnet transfers (using your system's QWK-ID for the
   user name), then edit your "Call-out Command Line" in SCFG->Networks->QWK->
   Hubs->VERT: replace "YOURPASS" with the password you used when creating
   your QWKnet user account. Do NOT change anything else in the command-line!
   That's it! For more details, see docs/dove-net.txt.

Q: What is my system's QWK-ID?
A: This is normally an abbreviation of your BBS's name that YOU determine
   and configure in SCFG->Message Options. You may want to look at NODES.DAT
   in DOVE-NET.ZIP for any conflicts with other DOVE-Net systems' QWK-IDs.

Q: How do I get my FTP server to work behind my firewall/NAT/router?
A: See http://synchro.net/docs/tcpip_faq.html for details.

Q: How do I disable the New User Feedback requirement?
A: In sbbs v3.10-win32, run the Configuration Wizard and un-check the
   "Require new user feedback" checkbox. Otherwise, set SCFG->Nodes->Node 1
   ->Advanced Options->Validation User to "0".

Q: What is the "!QWKTOMSG failed" or "Duplicate message" warnings in my 
   Telnet/Event log while importing DOVE-Net QWK packets into my message 
   areas?
A: This warning indicates a duplicate message in your QWK packet was detected. 
   Duplicate messages in the SYNCDATA echo are normal and you can disable the 
   duplicate message checking for that echo in SCFG->Message Areas->DOVE-Net
   ->SYNCDATA and the warnings should go away.

Q: How do I join/setup a FidoNet Technology Network (FTN)?
A: Use SBBSecho (included with Synchronet) to toss (export) and scan (import)
   your FidoNet bundles, packets, and NetMail (see
   http://synchro.net/docs/sbbsecho.html for details).

   You will also need a TCP/IP FTN transport program like Binkd, Internet Rex,
   Argus, Beemail, etc. Traditional Front-End Mailers (FrontDoor, InterMail,
   D'bridge, BinkleyTerm, etc) are NOT normally used for TCP/IP-based FTN
   transfers.
   See http://net229.darktech.org/fidosetup/ for instructions on setting up 
   Synchronet with the Argus 32-bit FidoNet mailer for Windows.
   I, personally, use Binkd for Win32 or Unix/Linux, which you can find
   available for download on Vertrauen and the docs (what little there are)
   online and example setup in docs/binkdex.html.

Q: How do I import newsgroups into my board.
A: Synchronet v3.10 comes with NewsLink, an external JavaScript module for
   importing and exporting messages via NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol).
   See docs/newslink.txt for details.

Q: How do I keep external programs (doors) from popping up windows and
   stealing the keyboard/mouse focus (Windows)?
A: Check SBBSCTRL:Telnet->Configure->Minimize Externals.

Q: How do I set additional nodes for telnet access (Windows)?
A: Create the additional nodes in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->Nodes if you
   haven't already done so (Version 3 uses the same configuration information
   from the first telnet node for all telnet nodes and the COM port/modem
   configuration information is ignored). Set SBBSCTRL:Telnet->Config->Last
   Node to highest node number you want available for telnet logins.

Q: How do I add files to the file database?
A: The easiest way is to use the ADDFILES utility which can automatically
   detect and import embedded descriptions (e.g. FILE_ID.DIZ). See the
   chapter in the sysop manual on "Adding files" and the ADDFILES utility
   chapter for details. No, a files.bbs list is not necessary for adding
   files. Use "ADDFILES * /DIZ" to search all directories for a new files.bbs,
   import any embedded descriptions (e.g. FILE_ID.DIZ), and delete the file.bbs
   after importing it. If you don't have a file list (e.g. files.bbs) to import
   just use "ADDFILES * /SZN" to search all directories for new files and use
   embedded (FILE_ID.DIZ) description files, if they exist.

Q: Long filename support doesn't seem to be fully functional.
A: Support for files with long filenames (greater than the MS-DOS 8.3 format)
   is a work in progress.
   The file database format is being replaced in v4.00 and will store long
   filenames as well as many other improvements.

Q: How do I enable forced upload/download ratios.
A: By default, Synchronet utilizes a "credit" system, where a user typically
   earns credits by uploading files, posting messages, playing online games, 
   etc. And downloading files requires a number of credits based on the size
   of the file.

   If you prefer to use a less flexible upload/download "ratio" system, you
   can do so by using the UDR (upload/download byte ratio) or UDFR
   (upload/download file ratio) ARS keywords in the Download Requirements of
   your file areas. These ARS keywords, like the PCR (post/call ratio) keyword
   use a specified minimum "percentage". So if you wish to enforce a 1:3
   upload/download ratio, then use "UDFR 33" for 33%, 3:4 ratio would be
   "UDFR 75" for 75%, 1:2 would be "UDFR 50" for 50%, etc.
   See http://synchro.net/docs/security.html for details on using ARS.

Q: How do I allow users to send Internet e-mail from the BBS?
A: See http://synchro.net/docs/message_section.html for details.

Q: How do I disallow connections from specific host names or IP addresses 
   (or ranges).
A: Add the disallowed host names to your text/host.can file or IP addresses
   to your text/ip.can file. To disallow a range of IP addresses, use the ^
   wildcard character (e.g. "192.168.10.^"). To disallow a partial string in a
   host name, use the ~ wildcard character (e.g. "mofoisp.com~").
   in Synchronet v3.10+, you can use the familiar '*' wildcard character
   (e.g. "*.aol.com" and "192.168.*").

Q: How do I allow anonymous logins to the Synchronet FTP Server?
A: You need to create a Guest account on your BBS. Create a new user (login
   as "New" or use the User Editor included with v3.00b) with a user name of
   "Guest". Give this user the 'G' exemption and the 'G', 'M', and 'F'
   restrictions and delete the password for the account. You may also want
   to give the Guest account additional exemptions (e.g. L, P, T, etc).
A: Or preferably, run the exec/makeguest.js script included with v3.11+.

Q: How can I get door X to work?
A: If the door wasn't specifically written to run on Synchronet (XSDK) or
   WWIV BBS Software (typically using CHAIN.TXT), then it must support FOSSIL
   communications (most popular doors support FOSSIL) and the door must be
   configured to use a FOSSIL driver (yes, you'll need to read the door's
   documentation files).
   The Synchronet FOSSIL driver is automatically configured and loaded when
   needed and ignores the COM port information used by doors, so configuration
   details such as COM port number and baud rate are irrelevant (you can just
   leave them set to their default values if the door configuration program
   allows them to be changed, or use COM1/38400 if it makes you happy).

Q: How can I get this FOSSIL door to work?
A: Make sure you have "Intercept I/O Interrupts" set to "No" for all FOSSIL
   doors in SBBSCTRL:BBS->Configure->External Programs->Online Programs
   (this includes Synchronet Match Maker v2.x).
   Make sure you have the appropriate startup directory, command line, and
   drop file options set in SCFG. See SBBSDOOR.TXT for specific instructions
   on setting up some popular door games (i.e. LORD, BRE, GlobalWar, TW2002).
   Make sure you DO NOT have any FOSSIL drivers loaded (including X00, BNU,
   ADF, COM/IP, WinFOSSIL, or NetModem) as they will conflict with
   Synchronet's FOSSIL driver.
   Make sure the door supports FOSSIL communications (read the door's docs)
   and that the door is configured to use a FOSSIL driver. Synchronet's
   FOSSIL driver is automatically configured and loaded when needed - there
   is nothing you need to do to install or load the Synchronet FOSSIL driver.

As always, see the documentation if you have any questions that aren't

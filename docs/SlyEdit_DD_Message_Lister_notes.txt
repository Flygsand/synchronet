Please note that if you use Digital Distortion Message Lister, you must update
the message lister to version 1.36 in order for it to work properly with
SlyEdit (1.27).  The reason is due to the way SlyEdit looks up message header
information to get author's initials when quoting messages, and due to
information that Digital Distortion Message Lister provides to SlyEdit.
Version 1.36 of the message lister now always writes the message number to its
drop file (earlier versions wrote either the message number or message offset,
depending on the version and build of Synchronet).  This version of SlyEdit
simplified the way it decides to use the message number or offset and required
the aforementioned change in Digital Distortion Message Lister.

Below is a version table listing the required versions of Digital Distortion
Message Lister with the recent versions of SlyEdit:

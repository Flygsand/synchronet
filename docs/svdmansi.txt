SVDMANSI.COM -- OS/2 Virtual DOS Machine ANSI Driver for Synchronet

    This program is a direct replacement for OS2FIX.COM, which,
although it solves an incompatibility problem between the OS/2 VDM and
native DOS, leaves the VDM without ANSI support.

    OS2FIX.COM is now obsolete, SVDMANSI is to be used in place of
it.  If you are not familiar with the way OS2FIX worked: remove the
line (if any) containing ANSI.SYS from DOS_DEVICE in the DOS session's
settings, and place a line "SVDMANSI" in the file specified by the
setting DOS_AUTOEXEC, before any ANSI codes are output to the screen.

    The basic ANSI codes are supported.  Not supported are cursor
position report (usually only used to detect the presence of an ANSI
driver, and handled by the BBS itself), and keyboard key redefinition
(less an omission than a safety feature).  If you have any questions
or problems with this program, you can send me e-mail on Vertrauen

    If you continue to use this program after the 30-day evaluation
period, please send 5 cents to the Clinton Legal Defense Fund, or
$1 to the charity of your choice.

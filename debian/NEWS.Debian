Synchronet for Debian
----------------------

    After configureing Synchronet, set SBBS_ENABLE to Yes in /etc/default/synchronet.

    This version of the package uses a pre-compiled version of the cryptlib
library and is therefore not ready for inclusion into the Debian distribution
nor is it really usuable for other than i386.  See also debian/TODO.
